# FakeStore E-Commerce App (Flutter Training Project)

A fake e-commerce mobile app built with Flutter for training and learning purposes.
This project integrates modern Flutter best practices such as Clean Architecture, SOLID principles, BLoC State Management, Dependency Injection, Code Generation, and reusable UI components.

The app uses data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to simulate a real shopping experience, dessign is inspired by this [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/YcM0d8j6JlbGpUWObkWEx4/Mobile-eCommerce-Clothing-Store-App-Design--Community-?node-id=1-3&p=f&t=mCIYC4uqNMsoXTD8-0).

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fakestore-flutter.git
   cd fakestore-flutter
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run code generation**

   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

4. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

5. **Paymob Details**
 
   to make PayMob work, you need to add a json file in the project root folder with this format:
```
{
  "API_KEY": "", 
  "CARD_ID": "",
  "WALLET_ID": "",
  "IFRAME_ID": ""
}
```
you will need to inject the file into your run with these args: --dart-define-from-file=keys.json (add them to your run configuration)
